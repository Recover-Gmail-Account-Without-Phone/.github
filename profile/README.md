## **Recover Gmail Account Without Phone Number End**

Now, let's go through the process of recovering a Gmail account without using a **number of your phone.

**1. Recovery via Alternate E-Mail
If you have a recovery e-mail set up for your Gmail account, this may be the easiest option to reset.

One should open the Google Help Center

2. Type your Gmail address, and then click **"Next."**
On the password screen, click **"Forgot password?
4. Enter the **last password you remember**. If not, click **"Try another way."**.

Click on the recovery email option. Google will send a verification link to your backup email.
Go to your recovery email, click the link, and follow the onscreen instructions to change it.

This will be most effective if that email recovery option in your settings is still accessible and/or up to date.

**2. Security Questions (If Set)
Before Google moved to using recovery emails and phone numbers, security questions could be a method of verification to identify an account owner. If you have ever set them up, you can use them now.

On the account recovery page click the **"Try another way,"** and you will be taken to a page of Google asking security questions.
2. Give correct answers. Questions may include when your account was created, who you would normally correspond with, or past passwords.

If your answers match what's in Google's records, permission to reset the password will be granted.

This technique is based on providing complete and correct answers; therefore, contemplate the answers properly.

**3. Using the Google Recovery Form

As a last resort, try the **Google Account Recovery Form: you can fill in all the information to support your ownership of the account.
1. Go to the recovery page, click on **"Try another way"**, until you get re-directed to the recovery form.
2. Give the data required, among them
- Date the account was created.

The most used places or devices:.
- Any passwords you have used before.
Just submit your form, and Google will take it further.

You will want to fill out the form in question as specifically possible to increase your odds of acceptance.

**4. Attempting to Log in from trusted devices
Google recognizes **trusted devices** you have used before to sign in. If you've ever signed in to your Gmail account on a device, you might be able to skip these extra recovery steps.

Go back to the recovery page and try another way; the system will prompt confirmation on a trusted device.
This will cause Google to send a notification to the device for confirmation.

3. Allow the request to access to your account and reset your password.

This is especially useful if you have enabled device recognition in your Google settings.

**5. Reaching out to Google Support

If the above ways did not help, look at further assistance through Google Support.

Go to the Google Help Center at.
2. Type in **"Gmail account recovery,"** and go through the links to reach support.
3. Please fill in all details of your account, including the date of the last successful login and the relevant recovery information.
